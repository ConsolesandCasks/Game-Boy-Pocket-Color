# Technical Design Document

This write-up serves as a technical explainer document for the MGBC project. I will not be covering the 5 V power supply board in detail in this explainer; this document is intended for the main MGBC-MBL-01 PCB only. Furthermore, I will not be explaining *every* circuit element in this document, especially the straightforward connections present on the original GBC schematic (i.e. cart connector, link port, etc). The majority of coverage here will be on the new features I have added to the project.

## Power Supply



## Power LED Indicator

## FFC Connector

## Audio Amplifier
